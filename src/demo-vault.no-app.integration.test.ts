// Keeps the in-repo `demo-vault/` in sync with the plugin's public surface WITHOUT
// Launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// Setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). Custom Attachment Location customizes where/how attachments are
// Saved through its settings, so only the PluginSettings config class is reflected;
// The plugin's runtime behavior is covered by the other integration tests.
